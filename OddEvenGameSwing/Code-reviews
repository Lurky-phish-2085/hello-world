CODE-REVIEWS

- write explicit access modifiers and arrange your methods with the public ones first followed by the private methods
- in OddOrEvenGame.java:5 - consider renaming Player p1 
- in OddOrEvenGame.java:11 - code smell, Player fields are not initialized
- I suggest separating the responsibility of NumberGenerator and make it really just generate number(s). It seems that you want to represent a number along with its parity, so I suggest creating a separate one - GeneratedNumber perhaps.
- consider moving the field score to Player class since it's the player the owns the score not the game
- minor: try replacing arrays with list so you won't have to deal with the low-level details of the collection
